# randomwav
Generate a random .wav file and play it in the browser!
This uses NodeJS & some libraries so you'll need to have nodejs & npm installed. When you pull the repo you'll need to do 
"npm install" to download the required libraries. After doing so you will be able to simply run the index.js then go to 
localhost:8000 to use the app.

Have fun!
